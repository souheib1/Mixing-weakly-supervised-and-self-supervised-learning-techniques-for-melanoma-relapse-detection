How to activate conda environment: 
	## Conda already installed to initialize use the next code (just one time)
	cd /tsi/data_education/IMA206/2022-2023/VisioMel/miniconda3/bin
	./conda init
	
	## Close the terminal session and open new one (important to launch the conda)
	## I have already created the environment whose name is solo 
	## To activate use the next command(everytime you will open new terminal session)
	conda activate solo
